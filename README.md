Static landing page for fictional library

More practice with HTML & CSS. Structuring and styling a static web page modeled after the home page of my local library. Special effort is made to use CSS Flexbox as much as reasonable. To be clear, this website is largely speaking a structural copy of an existing website. I do not take credit for the design, this is just for practice. Support your local libraries!
